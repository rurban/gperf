# Convenience script for regenerating all autogeneratable files that are
# omitted from the version control repository. In particular, this script
# also regenerates all config.h.in, configure files with new versions of
# autoconf.
#
# This script requires autoconf-2.64..2.71 in the PATH.
# It also requires either
#   - the GNULIB_TOOL environment variable pointing to the gnulib-tool script
#     in a gnulib checkout, or
#   - an internet connection.
